Overview
====

A Coq thacktic that uses the "Unix.fork" primitive to dispatch the execution of
several tactics on their own OS process.

Detail
====
This module declare the fork tactic.

It can be used with the following syntax:

  fork tac >> f

where [tac] and [f] are two tactics. The first tactic [tac] is used to generate
a list of goals, and [f] is subsequently used to solve them, exactly as would do

  tac; first [solve [f] | idtac]

There is a practical difference, though: the tactic [f] is executed in a forked
thread for each subgoal generated by [tac].

There is also an alternative version using a different tactic for each subgoal:

  fork tac >> [f1 | ... | fn]

which has the same semantics as:

  tac; [ first[solve[f1]|idtac] | ... | first[solve[f1]|idtac] ]
